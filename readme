Files for the game logic and replay system were provided in .py modules imported in the first frame. The test logic and model initialization were also provided. 
My contribution was the code used to train the model, specifically how it should loop through each playthrough-epoch, right up until the pass-state checks and terminal feedback. 

Through this course, I believe my greatest takeaway (aside from a definite budding interest in using/training ai models and building more of my own) is that as ai takes on more responsibility and tasks for society,
the data and methodologies for training the models will require significant forethought and continuous examination. It became clear both through our own technical tests and stories/articles we read that failing
this step can have fairly dramatic consequences (though not always necessarily impactful ones).
